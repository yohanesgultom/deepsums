All 600 workers at the Luoyang Cement Products Factory fear a cheap sale of both state assets and their future, the New York-based Human Rights in China reported.
Small-scale demonstrations have become almost daily occurrences in many Chinese cities as workers, the unemployed, farmers and pensioners feel they are losing out to market reforms and being abandoned by an indifferent or corrupt officialdom.
The contentious sale of the Luoyang cement factory underscores the dangers facing Beijing a year into its ambitious three-year plan to reform the largely inefficient, virtually bankrupt state sector.
Unrest among workers _ long used to the cradle-to-grave services of central planning _ has sharpened.
Human Rights in China said the protesters believed that the privatization plan would leave them without jobs and pensions.
They also contended that the plant was one of the city's top 100 taxpayers as recently as 1996, with 200 million yuan (dlrs 24.2 million) in assets.
Mr. Pan of the Luoyang Economic and Trade Commission said the sale will be put on hold until all concerns are settled.
Many of the pedicab drivers are disabled and depend on their jobs hauling passengers and small loads of furniture and other goods for their livelihood.
They resumed their protest Wednesday morning, the human rights center said.
Xi'an, a grimy industrial city that was once the imperial capital on China's Silk Road, has been the site of several protests in recent months.
The demonstrations are the latest in steady outbursts of unrest as reform-minded Chinese leaders allow bankrupt state industries to lay off millions of workers.
In cities throughout China, many of the unemployed have taken to driving taxis and pedicabs to make ends meet.
In May, some 500 taxi drivers surrounded Xi'an government offices to protest licensing fees they believed were unfair.

Since last year, Yili police have set up 33 new stations and hired 456 additional officers, it said.
The Uighurs, Xinjiang's main ethnic group, briefly ran an independent state before communist forces retook the region in 1949.
China has tried to counter the effect by improving relations with Kazakstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and getting them to pledge not to support anti-Chinese separatists.
After an unusual Sunday trial in the southern province of Hunan that lasted less than three hours, the defendant, Zhang Shanguang, 42, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, according to the group Human Rights in China, based in New York.
Numerous such farmer protests have been reported around the country in recent years and top national leaders have spoken out against high, unfair burdens put on peasants by local and county governments.
Radio Free Asia, which was set up in 1996 and receives all of its funds from Congress, broadcasts news and other programs into China from transmitters in Central Asia and the Pacific.
The Chinese government sees the network as hostile and tries, with some success, to jam the broadcasts, which often emphasize democracy-related subjects that are banned in the national media.
``If they want to do someone in like this, they can always find an excuse,'' Southerland said.
Radio Free Asia, which broadcasts in native languages to eight countries where news is censored, frequently quotes Chinese residents on its programs, though does not use names when it appears the speaker would be endangered.
Reeling from the recent trials, China's remaining dissidents are now waiting to see if the government will stop with the jailing of a few leaders or continue on with more arrests.
In two recent speeches, widely publicized by the official media, President and Communist Party Chief Jiang Zemin stressed the overriding importance of protecting social stability and said that any threats to the supremacy of the Communist Party would be ``annihilated in the early stages.
Western governments as well as democracy advocates here had hoped that China's signing this year of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which calls for free speech and assembly, would lead to a softening of political controls.
Many of them come from surplus factory worker forces, which stand at a staggering 20 million.
However, Li said, the ongoing reemployment project has scored great achievements.
Each year from 1992 to 1996, the newly employed outnumbered the laid-offs by a margin of eight million, thus maintaining an annual unemployment rate in urban areas at about 3 percent throughout.
That is disturbing behavior from a Chinese leadership that proclaims its commitment to economic reform and modernization and that signed the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights guaranteeing Chinese citizens free expression, assembly and religion.
The Falun Gong says it has no political agenda, but it has a popular exiled leader, tens of millions of followers and a remarkable ability to organize protests under the noses of China's omnipresent police.
Rapidly growing religious cults are particularly frightening to Chinese governments because of their historical role in sparking unrest.
Growth rates are falling and unemployment rising.
New reforms advocated by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji like slimming state enterprises and liberalizing trade threaten further dislocation.
Those who have attended protest rallies are simply exercising internationally recognized rights of association and expression for which they should not be punished or forced to submit to ideological training.
China cannot arrive at the modern future it wants by returning to the ideological monitoring and indoctrination methods of the past.
BEIJING _ China intensified its offensive against the Buddhist Law spiritual movement Thursday, announcing a ban on the organization and unleashing a barrage of charges against its founder that revealed how seriously the government takes the sect as a challenge to its rule.
The government's ban on the group, known in Chinese as Falun Gong, had been rumored since the police rounded up more than 100 leaders of the sect in several Chinese cities earlier this week.
But the ferocity of Beijing's campaign, aimed at a group of mainly middle-aged people who practice a form of Chinese breathing exercises and meditation, suggests that it regards Falun Gong as more than a movement of physical and moral uplift.
At a time when China's economy is slowing and social unrest is rising, officials here view this amorphous but fast-growing sect as a dangerous political force.
Human Rights in China said the protesters believed that the privatization plan would leave them without jobs and pensions.
But the city agreed to sell the factory for 2 million yuan (dlrs 242,000) to the private Zhongtai Company, Human Rights in China said.
A group of about 150 people were protesting the government's failure to allocate them new housing after they were evicted from their homes for redevelopment, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
They were soon joined by some 200 pedicab drivers protesting the city's decision ahead of Clinton's June 25-26 visit not to allow them to work as taxi drivers, the group said.
Many of the pedicab drivers are disabled and depend on their jobs hauling passengers and small loads of furniture and other goods for their livelihood.
Police did not intervene, and the demonstrators dispersed at about 6 p.m.
Tuesday.
Xi'an police and government officials denied that any protests had occurred, although they confirmed that the city had prohibited pedicab owners from hiring out their vehicles.
The attacks occured in the Yili district of Xinjiang, a large, restive region where Muslim separatists are battling Chinese rule.
Acts of violent terrorism have occured ``many times'' in Yili since last year, the Xinjiang Daily said in its Aug.
It gave no details of the crackdown but said some police officers were killed and injured.
Since last year, Yili police have set up 33 new stations and hired 456 additional officers, it said.
Xinjiang was ruled by Chinese emperors for 200 years as a buffer state between China and the Muslim nations of Central Asia.
Separatist sentiment, never fully quelled, has been reignited in recent years by the newly independent Central Asian nations created in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse and by Iran's Islamic revolution.
BEIJING _ Dealing out the fourth lengthy prison term to political dissenters in a week, China Sunday convicted a man for ``providing intelligence to hostile foreign organizations'' because he gave an interview about farmer protests to the U.S.-financed Radio Free Asia, a human rights group said.
After an unusual Sunday trial in the southern province of Hunan that lasted less than three hours, the defendant, Zhang Shanguang, 42, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, according to the group Human Rights in China, based in New York.
This year, before his detention in July, he had formed a group to protect laid-off workers and tried to register it with local officials.
Chinese authorities, fearing social unrest at a time of rising unemployment, appear to be especially fearful of any labor organizations outside Communist Party control, and of any efforts to link up disaffected workers with democracy campaigners.
At his brief trial Sunday in Huaihua City, Hunan, Zhang was charged with ``illegally providing intelligence to hostile foreign organizations and persons,'' according to his lawyer and relatives.
Numerous such farmer protests have been reported around the country in recent years and top national leaders have spoken out against high, unfair burdens put on peasants by local and county governments.
The Chinese government sees the network as hostile and tries, with some success, to jam the broadcasts, which often emphasize democracy-related subjects that are banned in the national media.
``We deeply regret this action,'' said Daniel Southerland, executive editor of Radio Free Asia, speaking by telephone from Washington Sunday.
Reeling from the recent trials, China's remaining dissidents are now waiting to see if the government will stop with the jailing of a few leaders or continue on with more arrests.
As far as Li was concerned, the employment situation in China faces both challenges and opportunities.
Li explained that while the number of laid-off workers is to increase in the wake of further reforms in state businesses, rapid development in non-public sectors and joint stock partnership businesses, on the other hand, will undoubtedly offer more job opportunities.
Each year, there are 10 million more people seeking jobs in towns and cities.
Many of them come from surplus factory worker forces, which stand at a staggering 20 million.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 28:
Beijing at first treated it cautiously, but has now banned the movement, confiscated its literature and detained thousands of members in a crackdown said to be ordered by President Jiang Zemin.
Growth rates are falling and unemployment rising.
For most of its followers, the Falun Gong is not about protest but traditional Chinese techniques of exercise, breathing and meditation believed to channel the body's spiritual energy.
China cannot arrive at the modern future it wants by returning to the ideological monitoring and indoctrination methods of the past.
The government's ban on the group, known in Chinese as Falun Gong, had been rumored since the police rounded up more than 100 leaders of the sect in several Chinese cities earlier this week.
The Ministry of Civil Affairs accused Falun Gong of ``inciting and creating disturbances, and jeopardizing social stability.
