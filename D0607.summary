All 600 workers at the Luoyang Cement Products Factory fear a cheap sale of both state assets and their future, the New York-based Human Rights in China reported.
About 200 workers besieged city government offices in Luoyang, in Henan province, from Monday to Friday last week demanding that approval of the sale to a private company be reversed, the group said.
Confirming the demonstrations, an official in charge of economic planning for Luoyang said the protesters dispersed after the government pledged to look into the workers' concerns.
Local officials have been quick to sell the best state assets, in some cases steering them to cronies.
Unrest among workers _ long used to the cradle-to-grave services of central planning _ has sharpened.
Human Rights in China said the protesters believed that the privatization plan would leave them without jobs and pensions.
They also contended that the plant was one of the city's top 100 taxpayers as recently as 1996, with 200 million yuan (dlrs 24.2 million) in assets.
But the city agreed to sell the factory for 2 million yuan (dlrs 242,000) to the private Zhongtai Company, Human Rights in China said.
Xi'an police and government officials denied that any protests had occurred, although they confirmed that the city had prohibited pedicab owners from hiring out their vehicles.
In cities throughout China, many of the unemployed have taken to driving taxis and pedicabs to make ends meet.
The attacks occured in the Yili district of Xinjiang, a large, restive region where Muslim separatists are battling Chinese rule.
Police responded with repeated efforts this year to suppress the terrorists, breaking up more than 10 criminal gangs, detaining a group of suspects and seizing guns and ammunition, the newspaper said.
It gave no details of the crackdown but said some police officers were killed and injured.
Since last year, Yili police have set up 33 new stations and hired 456 additional officers, it said.
Xinjiang was ruled by Chinese emperors for 200 years as a buffer state between China and the Muslim nations of Central Asia.
Separatist sentiment, never fully quelled, has been reignited in recent years by the newly independent Central Asian nations created in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse and by Iran's Islamic revolution.
BEIJING _ Dealing out the fourth lengthy prison term to political dissenters in a week, China Sunday convicted a man for ``providing intelligence to hostile foreign organizations'' because he gave an interview about farmer protests to the U.S.-financed Radio Free Asia, a human rights group said.
After an unusual Sunday trial in the southern province of Hunan that lasted less than three hours, the defendant, Zhang Shanguang, 42, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, according to the group Human Rights in China, based in New York.
Zhang previously spent seven years in prison for organizing an independent labor union in 1989.
Earlier this week, as part of the most severe crackdown on dissidents here in two years, three longtime activists who promoted a new China Democracy Party, Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai, were convicted on subversion charges and given sentences of 11 to 13 years.
At his brief trial Sunday in Huaihua City, Hunan, Zhang was charged with ``illegally providing intelligence to hostile foreign organizations and persons,'' according to his lawyer and relatives.
The Chinese government sees the network as hostile and tries, with some success, to jam the broadcasts, which often emphasize democracy-related subjects that are banned in the national media.
Reeling from the recent trials, China's remaining dissidents are now waiting to see if the government will stop with the jailing of a few leaders or continue on with more arrests.
In two recent speeches, widely publicized by the official media, President and Communist Party Chief Jiang Zemin stressed the overriding importance of protecting social stability and said that any threats to the supremacy of the Communist Party would be ``annihilated in the early stages.
But in recent weeks the government has made it clear that any actions perceived to imperil Communist Party rule will be defined as threats to national security _ and therefore outside the purview of the global treaty and other human rights conventions.
Li Boyong, a delegate to the on-going 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, said deepening reforms in state-owned enterprises will bring about certain pressure on employment in urban areas in China, but it is within the handling capacity of the society, and is far from touching off any social unrest.
"But no such 'disastrous outcome' as predicted by some overseas figures will go off," Li emphasized.
Li explained that while the number of laid-off workers is to increase in the wake of further reforms in state businesses, rapid development in non-public sectors and joint stock partnership businesses, on the other hand, will undoubtedly offer more job opportunities.
The abundant labor resource in China, which totals 834 million in number, does pose quite a headache to the country's employment, he said.
However, Li said, the ongoing reemployment project has scored great achievements.
In a step recalling Maoist political re-education campaigns, Beijing has sent 1,200 officials belonging to the Falun Gong spiritual movement to special schools to study Communist literature and recant their allegiance to the group.
Beijing at first treated it cautiously, but has now banned the movement, confiscated its literature and detained thousands of members in a crackdown said to be ordered by President Jiang Zemin.
New religious groups have grown in recent years as the discrediting of Communist ideology and the suppression of democracy movements have left a spiritual void.
None of this justifies the persecutions now under way.
Those who have attended protest rallies are simply exercising internationally recognized rights of association and expression for which they should not be punished or forced to submit to ideological training.
BEIJING _ China intensified its offensive against the Buddhist Law spiritual movement Thursday, announcing a ban on the organization and unleashing a barrage of charges against its founder that revealed how seriously the government takes the sect as a challenge to its rule.
After Beijing handed down its edict Thursday afternoon, it began an extraordinary public-relations assault on the group and its founder, Li Hongzhi, through state-run television and newspapers.
About 200 workers besieged city government offices in Luoyang, in Henan province, from Monday to Friday last week demanding that approval of the sale to a private company be reversed, the group said.
Small-scale demonstrations have become almost daily occurrences in many Chinese cities as workers, the unemployed, farmers and pensioners feel they are losing out to market reforms and being abandoned by an indifferent or corrupt officialdom.
The contentious sale of the Luoyang cement factory underscores the dangers facing Beijing a year into its ambitious three-year plan to reform the largely inefficient, virtually bankrupt state sector.
Human Rights in China said the protesters believed that the privatization plan would leave them without jobs and pensions.
But the city agreed to sell the factory for 2 million yuan (dlrs 242,000) to the private Zhongtai Company, Human Rights in China said.
The peaceful demonstrations by two groups with different grievances against the government began Tuesday morning.
Many of the pedicab drivers are disabled and depend on their jobs hauling passengers and small loads of furniture and other goods for their livelihood.

They resumed their protest Wednesday morning, the human rights center said.
Xi'an police and government officials denied that any protests had occurred, although they confirmed that the city had prohibited pedicab owners from hiring out their vehicles.
Xi'an, a grimy industrial city that was once the imperial capital on China's Silk Road, has been the site of several protests in recent months.

The demonstrations are the latest in steady outbursts of unrest as reform-minded Chinese leaders allow bankrupt state industries to lay off millions of workers.
In May, some 500 taxi drivers surrounded Xi'an government offices to protest licensing fees they believed were unfair.

Separatist sentiment, never fully quelled, has been reignited in recent years by the newly independent Central Asian nations created in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse and by Iran's Islamic revolution.
Zhang previously spent seven years in prison for organizing an independent labor union in 1989.
This year, before his detention in July, he had formed a group to protect laid-off workers and tried to register it with local officials.
Earlier this week, as part of the most severe crackdown on dissidents here in two years, three longtime activists who promoted a new China Democracy Party, Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai, were convicted on subversion charges and given sentences of 11 to 13 years.
``We deeply regret this action,'' said Daniel Southerland, executive editor of Radio Free Asia, speaking by telephone from Washington Sunday.
``If they want to do someone in like this, they can always find an excuse,'' Southerland said.
Reeling from the recent trials, China's remaining dissidents are now waiting to see if the government will stop with the jailing of a few leaders or continue on with more arrests.
In contrast to earlier decades, Chinese people today are fairly free to voice dissenting opinions in private _ so long as they do not act on them.
In two recent speeches, widely publicized by the official media, President and Communist Party Chief Jiang Zemin stressed the overriding importance of protecting social stability and said that any threats to the supremacy of the Communist Party would be ``annihilated in the early stages.
Western governments as well as democracy advocates here had hoped that China's signing this year of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which calls for free speech and assembly, would lead to a softening of political controls.
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official said here today that although deepening economic reform will cause certain pressure on employment, it will by no means touch off social unrest.
Li Boyong, a delegate to the on-going 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, said deepening reforms in state-owned enterprises will bring about certain pressure on employment in urban areas in China, but it is within the handling capacity of the society, and is far from touching off any social unrest.
The abundant labor resource in China, which totals 834 million in number, does pose quite a headache to the country's employment, he said.
Each year, there are 10 million more people seeking jobs in towns and cities.
In addition, approximately 130 million peasants have become idle in the rural areas, and may compete with urbanites for jobs.
However, Li said, the ongoing reemployment project has scored great achievements.
"Some people thought that the Falun Gong cult had no organizations and political programs.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 28:
That is disturbing behavior from a Chinese leadership that proclaims its commitment to economic reform and modernization and that signed the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights guaranteeing Chinese citizens free expression, assembly and religion.
The Falun Gong says it has no political agenda, but it has a popular exiled leader, tens of millions of followers and a remarkable ability to organize protests under the noses of China's omnipresent police.
Rapidly growing religious cults are particularly frightening to Chinese governments because of their historical role in sparking unrest.
New religious groups have grown in recent years as the discrediting of Communist ideology and the suppression of democracy movements have left a spiritual void.
