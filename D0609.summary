The Israeli group Peace Now said the construction site is more than 1 kilometer (mile) away from the Alei Zahav settlement.
Peace Now said Alei Zahav has about 100 homes now.
``This is a very desirable area,'' Ofri said, noting the proximity of the settlement to Israel and the Tel Aviv metropolitan area.
What impact have Israeli settlements in the West Bank had on the Israeli/Palestinian peace process?
"We have done a lot, and we will do a lot more," Netanyahu said while touring an industrial park under construction on empty land between two Jewish settlements in the West Bank, according to local television reports.
He symbolically signed a contract worth 1.7 million U.S. dollars for the first structure at the park, situated between the Jewish settlements of Psagot and Adam in central West Bank and planned for high-tech industry.
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Netanyahu, visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Martin Indyk Sunday reiterated that Washington is "concerned" about the ongoing expansion of settlements.
"We work very hard to ensure that unilateral actions on the Palestinian side are not taken...and we also have a responsibility to ensure that other actions aren't taken that can affect and prejudge the negotiations," he said.
Last week in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told visiting Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon that the settlement activities violate agreements signed by Israel and the Palestinians, which ban any unilateral actions by both sides.
Netanyahu said Israel has never agreed to limit the expansion of existing Jewish settlements.
Since the hard-line prime minister came to power in 1996, millions of shekels have been funnelled to the construction of new Jewish settlements or expansion of existing ones, and the Jewish population of the West Bank has grown by 30 percent.
During his visit to the industrial park, Netanyahu asked some 100 settlement leaders to work for his re-election.
In a related development in the West Bank, settlers moved four tents onto a hill near the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba outside Hebron Monday.
The settlers claimed the hilltop was within Kiryat Arba's perimeter, but Israeli soldiers declared it a closed military area and ordered them to leave.
JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a move seen by critics as a slap in the face of U.S. peacemakers, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to attend a ceremony Wednesday to confer city status on the Jewish West Bank settlement of Ariel.
Netanyahu's planned visit to Ariel came as U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was wrapping up her attempt to try to move Israeli and Palestinian leaders toward an agreement over a long-delayed Israeli pullback from part of the West Bank.
Nachman said the ceremony was set long before Albright's visit to Ariel was arranged.
Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, could not immediately be reached for comment.
He said Ariel has permission to build 2,600 additional units, but that because of a slump in the building industry the work has not begun.
Approval for the 3,000 units was given before 1992, when Israel's previous, moderate government announced a freeze on construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.
One of the first moves of Netanyahu's government in 1996 was to cancel the freeze.
Ariel was established in 1977.
Israel's ``Peace Now'' movement, which advocates an Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank in exchange for peace with the Palestinians, is planning a demonstration across from Ariel while the ceremony is in progress.
A Peace Now statement said that ``Netanyahu is spitting in Madeleine Albright's face'' by attending the ceremony.
``He is trying his best to sabotage the peace process,'' the group said.
He noted that the building of a kindergarten in the Jewish settlements used to be approved by a special ministerial committee in the last four years, calling it "discrimination" of Jewish settlers.
The Israeli premier declared that it will no longer continue like that, and from now on, only he himself and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordehai would give the greenlight.
However, he stressed that any proposal to build new settlements would still require a special full cabinet approval.
'' 	   The term is loosely defined and the Jewish settler movement usually plants trailer homes on hilltops near older, existing settlements, defines them as neighborhoods, and then slowly moves in families to the new area.
Land is at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Khalil Tufakji, chief cartographer for Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority charged that the new trailers were the beginning of a separate settlement and not part of El David.
Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the military government, said the trailers were set up with the approval of the Israel's defense ministry and would not remain in the area permanently.
``Every settlement begins with a trailer.
Noham Ochana, a youth counselor on the site, 15 youths live in the trailers, which he said were brought in about six months ago by a movement serving troubled teen-agers.

On Monday, the ongoing settlement activities led to the suspension of the Palestinian-Israeli final-status talks that deal with thorny issues including the future of the Israeli settlements.
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The new housing construction tenders for settlement expansion in the Israeli-occupied Arab territories would seriously jeopardize the peace process with the Palestinians and Syrians, said an Israeli peace group here Sunday.
Housing and Construction Minister Yitzhak Levy, from the National Religious Party, said Sunday the tenders were issued under the government's guidelines.
Israel Radio reported earlier that all those 2,600 tenders were issued after the new government came to power in July and 1,000 of them were slated for Ma'aleh Adumim, the largest settlement east of Jerusalem with about 6,000 settlers.
The other tenders were for several Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip is one of the thorny issues to be solved by Israel and the Palestines during their final-status talks which has been launched on September 13.
The Palestinian side has repeatedly asked Israel to halt the settlement expansions pending a final solution to this issue.
But Israel has declared to continue new house constructions in Ma'aleh Adumim, not matter what happens in the future.
The Palestinian side strongly criticized Barak for making such remarks.
Faisal Husseini, Palestinian Cabinet Minister in charge of Jerusalem Affairs, said "the only future in store for Ma'aleh Adumim is evacuation."
"Creating a mixture of Israeli settlements with Palestinian cities is nothing but a ticking time bomb that will only lead to situations like those in Kosovo," he added.
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Activists from Israel's Peace Now movement scuffled with Jewish settlers Friday when they toured a hilltop near a West Bank settlement to monitor what they called illegal settlement expansions.
JERUSALEM (AP) _ Coinciding with the start of a Mideast summit, Israel radio reported Thursday that bulldozers are leveling ground for the 12-fold expansion of a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
The Israeli group Peace Now said the construction site is more than 1 kilometer (mile) away from the Alei Zahav settlement.
The building constitutes the start of a new settlement, not the expansion of an existing one, the group said.
The Palestinians say settlement construction is part of an illegal land grab by Israel and undercuts their claims to statehood in the West Bank and Gaza.
'' 	   Peace Now leader Mossi Raz said that calling the project an expansion of Alei Zahav was a ruse.
He said that while the construction was taking place within the municipal boundaries of Alei Zahav, in fact a new, separate community was being built.
``Legally, it's not a new settlement, but for all intents and purposes, it is, to any rational person,'' Raz said.

JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- In defiance of fresh U.S. criticism over increasing Jewish settlement activities in the West Bank, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Monday pledged to further expand settlement construction.
He symbolically signed a contract worth 1.7 million U.S. dollars for the first structure at the park, situated between the Jewish settlements of Psagot and Adam in central West Bank and planned for high-tech industry.
Netanyahu's tour came only one day after a senior U.S. envoy publicly slammed Israel's intensified settlement activities in the West Bank in recent months.
