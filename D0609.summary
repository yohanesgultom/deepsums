JERUSALEM (AP) _ Coinciding with the start of a Mideast summit, Israel radio reported Thursday that bulldozers are leveling ground for the 12-fold expansion of a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
Peace Now said Alei Zahav has about 100 homes now.
Project manager Arieh Ofri told the radio that in the first stage, 100 homes would be built and future construction would depend on demand.
He said that while the construction was taking place within the municipal boundaries of Alei Zahav, in fact a new, separate community was being built.

"We have done a lot, and we will do a lot more," Netanyahu said while touring an industrial park under construction on empty land between two Jewish settlements in the West Bank, according to local television reports.
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Netanyahu, visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Martin Indyk Sunday reiterated that Washington is "concerned" about the ongoing expansion of settlements.
"We work very hard to ensure that unilateral actions on the Palestinian side are not taken...and we also have a responsibility to ensure that other actions aren't taken that can affect and prejudge the negotiations," he said.
Last week in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told visiting Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon that the settlement activities violate agreements signed by Israel and the Palestinians, which ban any unilateral actions by both sides.
Netanyahu said Israel has never agreed to limit the expansion of existing Jewish settlements.
Since the hard-line prime minister came to power in 1996, millions of shekels have been funnelled to the construction of new Jewish settlements or expansion of existing ones, and the Jewish population of the West Bank has grown by 30 percent.
In a related development in the West Bank, settlers moved four tents onto a hill near the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba outside Hebron Monday.
The settlers claimed the hilltop was within Kiryat Arba's perimeter, but Israeli soldiers declared it a closed military area and ordered them to leave.
Netanyahu's planned visit to Ariel came as U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was wrapping up her attempt to try to move Israeli and Palestinian leaders toward an agreement over a long-delayed Israeli pullback from part of the West Bank.
Mayor Ron Nachman told The Associated Press that there are plans to increase the population of the city from 17,000 to 30,000 by building 3,000 new housing units.
Nachman said the ceremony was set long before Albright's visit to Ariel was arranged.
Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, could not immediately be reached for comment.
Palestinians denounce the settlements as illegal incursions on their homeland.
He said Ariel has permission to build 2,600 additional units, but that because of a slump in the building industry the work has not begun.
One of the first moves of Netanyahu's government in 1996 was to cancel the freeze.
A Peace Now statement said that ``Netanyahu is spitting in Madeleine Albright's face'' by attending the ceremony.
``He is trying his best to sabotage the peace process,'' the group said.

The decision was made during today's weekly cabinet session, following a series of meetings between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and leaders of the settlements last month.
He noted that the building of a kindergarten in the Jewish settlements used to be approved by a special ministerial committee in the last four years, calling it "discrimination" of Jewish settlers.
Also today, Knesset (Israel's parliament) member of Meretz, Yossi Sarid said he had information on government plans for an unprecedented settlement campaign.
Former Finance Minister Avraham Shohat also added his voice to the criticism, warning the government's decision would lead to large scale of investments in the settlements, and would lead to reductions in American loan guarantee.
EL DAVID, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian officials said Thursday that eight new mobile homes set up in a remote area of the West Bank, half a mile from the nearest community, is a new settlement and a violation of peace accords.
Under pressure from the United States and the Palestinians to halt settlement construction, Israel has said it would not build new settlements but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu supports expanding new settlements to accommodate what he terms ``natural growth.
But successive Israeli government have encouraged Jewish settlement in those areas and today some 150,000 Jewish settlers live throughout the West Bank.
This is a violation of agreements,'' Tufakji told The Associated Press.
Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the military government, said the trailers were set up with the approval of the Israel's defense ministry and would not remain in the area permanently.
The trailers were set-up for a temporary period until a school can be renovated in the El-David settlement, Lerner said.
They put up a trailer and then they start to build, I don't care what they call it,'' said Hagit Yaari, a spokeswoman for Israel's Peace Now movement, which monitors settlement construction.
The Israeli authorities issued tenders for building 3,000 housing units early last July, the report said.
After learning that Israeli Housing and Construction Ministry has issued tenders for building 2,600 new houses for Jewish settlers in West Bank settlements, the Peace Now group said this action will cause more trouble for the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks
The group is scheduled to ask Prime Minister Ehud Barak to explain the government's policy toward the settlement expansion, the statement said.
Israel Radio reported earlier that all those 2,600 tenders were issued after the new government came to power in July and 1,000 of them were slated for Ma'aleh Adumim, the largest settlement east of Jerusalem with about 6,000 settlers.
Israel calls Ma'aleh Adumim a city, instead of settlement.
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip is one of the thorny issues to be solved by Israel and the Palestines during their final-status talks which has been launched on September 13.
The Palestinian side has repeatedly asked Israel to halt the settlement expansions pending a final solution to this issue.
But Israel has declared to continue new house constructions in Ma'aleh Adumim, not matter what happens in the future.
Faisal Husseini, Palestinian Cabinet Minister in charge of Jerusalem Affairs, said "the only future in store for Ma'aleh Adumim is evacuation."
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Activists from Israel's Peace Now movement scuffled with Jewish settlers Friday when they toured a hilltop near a West Bank settlement to monitor what they called illegal settlement expansions.
The Palestinians say settlement construction is part of an illegal land grab by Israel and undercuts their claims to statehood in the West Bank and Gaza.
Peace Now said Alei Zahav has about 100 homes now.
He said that while the construction was taking place within the municipal boundaries of Alei Zahav, in fact a new, separate community was being built.
``Legally, it's not a new settlement, but for all intents and purposes, it is, to any rational person,'' Raz said.
"We have done a lot, and we will do a lot more," Netanyahu said while touring an industrial park under construction on empty land between two Jewish settlements in the West Bank, according to local television reports.
He symbolically signed a contract worth 1.7 million U.S. dollars for the first structure at the park, situated between the Jewish settlements of Psagot and Adam in central West Bank and planned for high-tech industry.
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Netanyahu, visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Martin Indyk Sunday reiterated that Washington is "concerned" about the ongoing expansion of settlements.
"We work very hard to ensure that unilateral actions on the Palestinian side are not taken...and we also have a responsibility to ensure that other actions aren't taken that can affect and prejudge the negotiations," he said.
