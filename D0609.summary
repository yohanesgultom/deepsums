The Israeli group Peace Now said the construction site is more than 1 kilometer (mile) away from the Alei Zahav settlement.
The Palestinians say settlement construction is part of an illegal land grab by Israel and undercuts their claims to statehood in the West Bank and Gaza.
Israel radio said the Defense Ministry has approved the construction of 1,200 homes near Alei Zahav, which is located about 5 kilometers from the invisible line between Israel and the West Bank.
Project manager Arieh Ofri told the radio that in the first stage, 100 homes would be built and future construction would depend on demand.
``This is a very desirable area,'' Ofri said, noting the proximity of the settlement to Israel and the Tel Aviv metropolitan area.
``So far, everything that has been built has been sold.
'' 	   Peace Now leader Mossi Raz said that calling the project an expansion of Alei Zahav was a ruse.
He said that while the construction was taking place within the municipal boundaries of Alei Zahav, in fact a new, separate community was being built.
``Legally, it's not a new settlement, but for all intents and purposes, it is, to any rational person,'' Raz said.
What impact have Israeli settlements in the West Bank had on the Israeli/Palestinian peace process?
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- In defiance of fresh U.S. criticism over increasing Jewish settlement activities in the West Bank, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Monday pledged to further expand settlement construction.
"We have done a lot, and we will do a lot more," Netanyahu said while touring an industrial park under construction on empty land between two Jewish settlements in the West Bank, according to local television reports.
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Netanyahu, visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Martin Indyk Sunday reiterated that Washington is "concerned" about the ongoing expansion of settlements.
"We work very hard to ensure that unilateral actions on the Palestinian side are not taken...and we also have a responsibility to ensure that other actions aren't taken that can affect and prejudge the negotiations," he said.
Last week in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told visiting Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon that the settlement activities violate agreements signed by Israel and the Palestinians, which ban any unilateral actions by both sides.
In a related development in the West Bank, settlers moved four tents onto a hill near the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba outside Hebron Monday.
Netanyahu's planned visit to Ariel came as U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was wrapping up her attempt to try to move Israeli and Palestinian leaders toward an agreement over a long-delayed Israeli pullback from part of the West Bank.
Ariel is in the middle of the West Bank, 30 kilometers (18 miles) east of Tel Aviv.
Nachman said the ceremony was set long before Albright's visit to Ariel was arranged.
Nachman, an opponent of the Israeli-Palestinian autonomy accords, said the ceremony of declaring Ariel a city sends a message that Israel must strengthen its presence in the West Bank.
Palestinians denounce the settlements as illegal incursions on their homeland.
Nachman said 400 new apartments will be ready for occupancy in April.
He said Ariel has permission to build 2,600 additional units, but that because of a slump in the building industry the work has not begun.
Approval for the 3,000 units was given before 1992, when Israel's previous, moderate government announced a freeze on construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.
Nahcman said raising the status of Ariel to city is significant as a symbol ```City' means permanence, `settlement' means temporary,'' he said.
Israel's ``Peace Now'' movement, which advocates an Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank in exchange for peace with the Palestinians, is planning a demonstration across from Ariel while the ceremony is in progress.
``He is trying his best to sabotage the peace process,'' the group said.

JERUSALEM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government today authorized simpler procedure for granting permission for Jewish constructions in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, in a bid to ease the settlement building freeze imposed by the previous government.
The decision was made during today's weekly cabinet session, following a series of meetings between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and leaders of the settlements last month.
Netanyahu reportedly accused, at the cabinet meeting, the previous government of handicapping the natural developments of Jewish settlements, while failing to impose same restrictions on Palestinian buildings.
The Israeli premier declared that it will no longer continue like that, and from now on, only he himself and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordehai would give the greenlight.
Israeli media pointed out that the message appeared to be that the freeze of settlement activity is over, although no operative decision was made at today's cabinet meeting.
In reaction to the cabinet decision regarding to the settlements, the Council of Jewish Settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip warmly welcomed the decision.
However, the council also expressed its disappointment that there has been no decision on actual developments and buildings of the Jewish settlements.
Sarid, environment minister in the previous Labor-led government, charged that the settlement activity was the biggest enemy of the peace process.
EL DAVID, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian officials said Thursday that eight new mobile homes set up in a remote area of the West Bank, half a mile from the nearest community, is a new settlement and a violation of peace accords.
Land is at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Palestinians hope to create a future state on much of the West Bank land Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
But successive Israeli government have encouraged Jewish settlement in those areas and today some 150,000 Jewish settlers live throughout the West Bank.
``It's a new location and new settlers will be there.
The trailers were set-up for a temporary period until a school can be renovated in the El-David settlement, Lerner said.
``Every settlement begins with a trailer.
They put up a trailer and then they start to build, I don't care what they call it,'' said Hagit Yaari, a spokeswoman for Israel's Peace Now movement, which monitors settlement construction.

GAZA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel confiscated 17,000 donums (1,596.3 hectares) of Palestinian land in 1998 to expand Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and 154 Palestinians were killed in conflicts triggered by the expansion activities, said an official report.
The Israeli authorities issued tenders for building 3,000 housing units early last July, the report said.
On Monday, the ongoing settlement activities led to the suspension of the Palestinian-Israeli final-status talks that deal with thorny issues including the future of the Israeli settlements.
After learning that Israeli Housing and Construction Ministry has issued tenders for building 2,600 new houses for Jewish settlers in West Bank settlements, the Peace Now group said this action will cause more trouble for the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks
The other tenders were for several Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
The Palestinian side has repeatedly asked Israel to halt the settlement expansions pending a final solution to this issue.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a speech in the United Nations on Wednesday asked Israel again to immediately end the settlement expansions in the territories.
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, during his visit to this settlement on September 15, pledged to the settlers there that he will continue to expand it.
Barak said that Ma'aleh Adumim "is part of Greater Jerusalem."
"Creating a mixture of Israeli settlements with Palestinian cities is nothing but a ticking time bomb that will only lead to situations like those in Kosovo," he added.
JERUSALEM (AP) _ Coinciding with the start of a Mideast summit, Israel radio reported Thursday that bulldozers are leveling ground for the 12-fold expansion of a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
The building constitutes the start of a new settlement, not the expansion of an existing one, the group said.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised the United States and the Palestinians that he will not start new settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but only expand existing ones to accommodate natural population growth.
