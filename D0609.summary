JERUSALEM (AP) _ Coinciding with the start of a Mideast summit, Israel radio reported Thursday that bulldozers are leveling ground for the 12-fold expansion of a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised the United States and the Palestinians that he will not start new settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but only expand existing ones to accommodate natural population growth.
He said that while the construction was taking place within the municipal boundaries of Alei Zahav, in fact a new, separate community was being built.
``Legally, it's not a new settlement, but for all intents and purposes, it is, to any rational person,'' Raz said.
What impact have Israeli settlements in the West Bank had on the Israeli/Palestinian peace process?
"We work very hard to ensure that unilateral actions on the Palestinian side are not taken...and we also have a responsibility to ensure that other actions aren't taken that can affect and prejudge the negotiations," he said.
Last week in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told visiting Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon that the settlement activities violate agreements signed by Israel and the Palestinians, which ban any unilateral actions by both sides.
Netanyahu said Israel has never agreed to limit the expansion of existing Jewish settlements.
Since the hard-line prime minister came to power in 1996, millions of shekels have been funnelled to the construction of new Jewish settlements or expansion of existing ones, and the Jewish population of the West Bank has grown by 30 percent.
Ehud Barak, his main rival in the May elections for prime ministership, accuses Netanyahu of giving in to Jewish settlers to ensure their support for his power.
During his visit to the industrial park, Netanyahu asked some 100 settlement leaders to work for his re-election.
In a related development in the West Bank, settlers moved four tents onto a hill near the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba outside Hebron Monday.
The settlers claimed the hilltop was within Kiryat Arba's perimeter, but Israeli soldiers declared it a closed military area and ordered them to leave.
JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a move seen by critics as a slap in the face of U.S. peacemakers, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to attend a ceremony Wednesday to confer city status on the Jewish West Bank settlement of Ariel.
Ariel is in the middle of the West Bank, 30 kilometers (18 miles) east of Tel Aviv.
Mayor Ron Nachman told The Associated Press that there are plans to increase the population of the city from 17,000 to 30,000 by building 3,000 new housing units.
Nachman, an opponent of the Israeli-Palestinian autonomy accords, said the ceremony of declaring Ariel a city sends a message that Israel must strengthen its presence in the West Bank.
For more than two decades, U.S. governments have held that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal and are obstacles to peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
Palestinians denounce the settlements as illegal incursions on their homeland.
He said Ariel has permission to build 2,600 additional units, but that because of a slump in the building industry the work has not begun.
Approval for the 3,000 units was given before 1992, when Israel's previous, moderate government announced a freeze on construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.
Ariel was established in 1977.
Nahcman said raising the status of Ariel to city is significant as a symbol ```City' means permanence, `settlement' means temporary,'' he said.
Israel's ``Peace Now'' movement, which advocates an Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank in exchange for peace with the Palestinians, is planning a demonstration across from Ariel while the ceremony is in progress.

Netanyahu reportedly accused, at the cabinet meeting, the previous government of handicapping the natural developments of Jewish settlements, while failing to impose same restrictions on Palestinian buildings.
He noted that the building of a kindergarten in the Jewish settlements used to be approved by a special ministerial committee in the last four years, calling it "discrimination" of Jewish settlers.
However, he stressed that any proposal to build new settlements would still require a special full cabinet approval.
Sarid, environment minister in the previous Labor-led government, charged that the settlement activity was the biggest enemy of the peace process.
Under pressure from the United States and the Palestinians to halt settlement construction, Israel has said it would not build new settlements but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu supports expanding new settlements to accommodate what he terms ``natural growth.
``It's a new location and new settlers will be there.
This is a violation of agreements,'' Tufakji told The Associated Press.
The trailers were set-up for a temporary period until a school can be renovated in the El-David settlement, Lerner said.
``Every settlement begins with a trailer.
The Israeli authorities issued tenders for building 3,000 housing units early last July, the report said.
On Monday, the ongoing settlement activities led to the suspension of the Palestinian-Israeli final-status talks that deal with thorny issues including the future of the Israeli settlements.
After learning that Israeli Housing and Construction Ministry has issued tenders for building 2,600 new houses for Jewish settlers in West Bank settlements, the Peace Now group said this action will cause more trouble for the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks
The number of new tenders issued by the ministry exceeds the total number issued in the three years' tenure of the previous government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, the satement added.
The group is scheduled to ask Prime Minister Ehud Barak to explain the government's policy toward the settlement expansion, the statement said.
Meanwhile, Education Minister Yossi Sarid expressed his objection to settlement expansion in the West Bank, including the new tenders.
Housing and Construction Minister Yitzhak Levy, from the National Religious Party, said Sunday the tenders were issued under the government's guidelines.
Israel calls Ma'aleh Adumim a city, instead of settlement.
The Palestinian side has repeatedly asked Israel to halt the settlement expansions pending a final solution to this issue.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a speech in the United Nations on Wednesday asked Israel again to immediately end the settlement expansions in the territories.
But Israel has declared to continue new house constructions in Ma'aleh Adumim, not matter what happens in the future.
The Palestinian side strongly criticized Barak for making such remarks.
Faisal Husseini, Palestinian Cabinet Minister in charge of Jerusalem Affairs, said "the only future in store for Ma'aleh Adumim is evacuation."
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Activists from Israel's Peace Now movement scuffled with Jewish settlers Friday when they toured a hilltop near a West Bank settlement to monitor what they called illegal settlement expansions.
The Israeli group Peace Now said the construction site is more than 1 kilometer (mile) away from the Alei Zahav settlement.
Israel radio said the Defense Ministry has approved the construction of 1,200 homes near Alei Zahav, which is located about 5 kilometers from the invisible line between Israel and the West Bank.
Project manager Arieh Ofri told the radio that in the first stage, 100 homes would be built and future construction would depend on demand.
``This is a very desirable area,'' Ofri said, noting the proximity of the settlement to Israel and the Tel Aviv metropolitan area.
``So far, everything that has been built has been sold.
``Legally, it's not a new settlement, but for all intents and purposes, it is, to any rational person,'' Raz said.
What impact have Israeli settlements in the West Bank had on the Israeli/Palestinian peace process?
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Netanyahu, visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Martin Indyk Sunday reiterated that Washington is "concerned" about the ongoing expansion of settlements.
"We work very hard to ensure that unilateral actions on the Palestinian side are not taken...and we also have a responsibility to ensure that other actions aren't taken that can affect and prejudge the negotiations," he said.
Netanyahu said Israel has never agreed to limit the expansion of existing Jewish settlements.
Since the hard-line prime minister came to power in 1996, millions of shekels have been funnelled to the construction of new Jewish settlements or expansion of existing ones, and the Jewish population of the West Bank has grown by 30 percent.

Mayor Ron Nachman told The Associated Press that there are plans to increase the population of the city from 17,000 to 30,000 by building 3,000 new housing units.
Nachman said the ceremony was set long before Albright's visit to Ariel was arranged.
Palestinians denounce the settlements as illegal incursions on their homeland.
One of the first moves of Netanyahu's government in 1996 was to cancel the freeze.
Nahcman said raising the status of Ariel to city is significant as a symbol ```City' means permanence, `settlement' means temporary,'' he said.
Israel's ``Peace Now'' movement, which advocates an Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank in exchange for peace with the Palestinians, is planning a demonstration across from Ariel while the ceremony is in progress.
``He is trying his best to sabotage the peace process,'' the group said.
The decision was made during today's weekly cabinet session, following a series of meetings between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and leaders of the settlements last month.
Netanyahu reportedly accused, at the cabinet meeting, the previous government of handicapping the natural developments of Jewish settlements, while failing to impose same restrictions on Palestinian buildings.
Israeli media pointed out that the message appeared to be that the freeze of settlement activity is over, although no operative decision was made at today's cabinet meeting.
In reaction to the cabinet decision regarding to the settlements, the Council of Jewish Settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip warmly welcomed the decision.
Sarid, environment minister in the previous Labor-led government, charged that the settlement activity was the biggest enemy of the peace process.
Under pressure from the United States and the Palestinians to halt settlement construction, Israel has said it would not build new settlements but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu supports expanding new settlements to accommodate what he terms ``natural growth.
Palestinians hope to create a future state on much of the West Bank land Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
But successive Israeli government have encouraged Jewish settlement in those areas and today some 150,000 Jewish settlers live throughout the West Bank.
Khalil Tufakji, chief cartographer for Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority charged that the new trailers were the beginning of a separate settlement and not part of El David.
``Every settlement begins with a trailer.
They put up a trailer and then they start to build, I don't care what they call it,'' said Hagit Yaari, a spokeswoman for Israel's Peace Now movement, which monitors settlement construction.

GAZA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel confiscated 17,000 donums (1,596.3 hectares) of Palestinian land in 1998 to expand Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and 154 Palestinians were killed in conflicts triggered by the expansion activities, said an official report.
The Jewish settlement activities also led to the destruction of 20,000 trees and 157 Palestinian houses, the withdrawal of the identity cards of 420 Palestinian citizens living in Jerusalem, said an annual report issued on Tuesday by the Palestinian National Committee on Settlement Combat.
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza reached 200, with settlers to be 170,000 by the end of the year 2000.
On Monday, the ongoing settlement activities led to the suspension of the Palestinian-Israeli final-status talks that deal with thorny issues including the future of the Israeli settlements.
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The new housing construction tenders for settlement expansion in the Israeli-occupied Arab territories would seriously jeopardize the peace process with the Palestinians and Syrians, said an Israeli peace group here Sunday.
The number of new tenders issued by the ministry exceeds the total number issued in the three years' tenure of the previous government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, the satement added.
The group is scheduled to ask Prime Minister Ehud Barak to explain the government's policy toward the settlement expansion, the statement said.
Meanwhile, Education Minister Yossi Sarid expressed his objection to settlement expansion in the West Bank, including the new tenders.
Israel Radio reported earlier that all those 2,600 tenders were issued after the new government came to power in July and 1,000 of them were slated for Ma'aleh Adumim, the largest settlement east of Jerusalem with about 6,000 settlers.
The Palestinian side has repeatedly asked Israel to halt the settlement expansions pending a final solution to this issue.
But Israel has declared to continue new house constructions in Ma'aleh Adumim, not matter what happens in the future.
The Palestinian side strongly criticized Barak for making such remarks.
"Creating a mixture of Israeli settlements with Palestinian cities is nothing but a ticking time bomb that will only lead to situations like those in Kosovo," he added.

Israeli media pointed out that the message appeared to be that the freeze of settlement activity is over, although no operative decision was made at today's cabinet meeting.
Former Finance Minister Avraham Shohat also added his voice to the criticism, warning the government's decision would lead to large scale of investments in the settlements, and would lead to reductions in American loan guarantee.
Israel's military government in the West Bank said the trailers stood on land belonging to the El David settlement which is located on a hilltop about 800 meters, or half a mile, from the trailer park.
'' 	   The term is loosely defined and the Jewish settler movement usually plants trailer homes on hilltops near older, existing settlements, defines them as neighborhoods, and then slowly moves in families to the new area.
``It's a new location and new settlers will be there.
This is a violation of agreements,'' Tufakji told The Associated Press.
Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the military government, said the trailers were set up with the approval of the Israel's defense ministry and would not remain in the area permanently.
The trailers were set-up for a temporary period until a school can be renovated in the El-David settlement, Lerner said.
