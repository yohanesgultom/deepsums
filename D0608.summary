Studies show more than 80 percent of child seats are improperly installed.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched its look at ways to improve child seat safety, including a possible rating system, with a public hearing on Wednesday.
If a rating system is developed it needs to include real-world performance, not just crash-test results, Stephanie M. Tombrello of SafetyBeltSafe U.S.A. said.
"Not all test data are of equal importance," she said, noting that measurements of head movement, chest acceleration and knee movement in a crash are among pieces of information collected.
Robert B. Waller, Jr.
He suggested improved instructions and warning labels for the seats, adding that some current mandatory labeling requires a 12th grade education to understand.
Cischke said some of the more common mistakes were getting the wrong sized-seat for the child and moving an infant into a forward-facing seat too quickly.
But until DaimlerChrysler's announcement, no automaker offered parents the chance to make an appointment at dealerships on such a wide scale.
At least 15 infants have been killed this way by air bags since   1994, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.
The BabySmart seats send and receive signals from two antennas   in the seat cushion.
Air bags in some Mercedes-Benz models are  supposed to recognize that a BabySmart seat has been installed and  turn off the passenger air bag.
But Mercedes-Benz said Tuesday that if the child seat is pushed   forward when the seat back is leaning toward the dashboard, the  passenger airbag might not turn off as designed.
Drivers would know the system was not working only because an   ``airbag off'' light would stay dark.
Mercedes-Benz said there have  been four reports that the indicator light was off, but no reports  of accidents or injuries.
The company recommended the seats not be used and that children   sit in the back seat until the problem is fixed.
OTTAWA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government has told automakers to improve airbag safety or face new regulations as early as the next fall.
The government wants automakers to change airbag design voluntarily for 1998 models, make airbags to deploy with less force, and not to deploy at speeds as low as they do now.
"If the cooperation isn't there, we would have to regulate," Anderson warned.
Auto airbags were introduced in the late 1980s to reduce accident injuries to drivers and passengers.
They have since saved an estimated 100 lives in Canada.
In Canada, 92 percent drivers and passengers wear belts.
But the airbags are deployed with the same force as in the United States, which can kill or hurt people who are not sitting properly.
Previously, officers issued summonses only after stopping drivers for other reasons -- such as speeding -- and found them or their front-seat passengers without seat belts.
Conaway, who is a doctor, said the change also will benefit children, who are the most vulnerable to injury in automobile accidents.
''By enforcing that requirement, we know the percentage of adults who wear seat belts will go up, but more importantly, the number of children will also go up,'' Conaway said.
Conaway said the council's statistics show children are belted in only 20 percent of the time when adults they ride with are not.
The safety coalition predicts the greater enforcement will save up to 50 lives and prevent nearly 2,900 serious injuries per year.
The New Jersey chapter of the National Motorists Association opposed the change, arguing that it would be difficult to enforce and that the number of traffic deaths on New Jersey roads reached a 20-year low in 1999.
DaimlerChrysler is the first automaker to accept a federal   agency's challenge by creating a permanent free service using  trained personnel to help customers fit child seats.
More than 80 percent of child seats are improperly installed in   autos.
``Parents need help to make sure their children are properly   secured in those seats,'' Robert Eaton, DaimlerChrysler  co-chairman, said at a news conference.
Each year, frustrated parents struggle to install about 70   models of child car seats in hundreds of types of cars with  different shapes of back seats, meaning there are ``potentially  100,000 different ways to confuse the average consumer,'' NTSB  Chairman Jim Hall says.
This decade, more than 60,000 children have died in traffic   crashes.
``I am  confident the other automobile manufacturers in our country will  step forward now with their own programs,'' he said.
General Motors Corp.
also is considering some type of permanent   fitting stations in its dealerships, spokesman Greg Martin said.
Since 1996, GM has worked with the National Safe Kids Campaign,   a nonprofit group that promotes child safety, to hold weekend or  daylong child-safety-seat checks at about 1,000 of the company's  dealerships.
Federal regulators Thursday warned consumers that side air bags can kill or seriously injure children under 12 and urged manufacturers installing the devices in rear seats to let drivers decide if they want them activated.
Although BMW already allows customers to tell dealers whether they want rear seat air bags activated, a Mercedes spokesman said the company has no plans to follow suit.
``We don't believe it's in the consumer's best interests,'' said Stuart Schorr, a Mercedes spokesman.
There have been no deaths or serious injuries attributed to side air bags.
What devices and procedures have been implemented to improve automobile safety?
WASHINGTON (AP) -- With federal regulators pondering whether they should start rating child safety seats, a major automaker began offering parents a free seat checkup service, regardless of what kind of car they have.
Child safety seats prevent thousands of deaths and injuries annually, but federal officials and safety experts say a large share of those in use are not installed correctly, posing a possible hazard to children riding in them.
"A rating system that is simply a star system can hinder safety because parents stop asking questions," she said.
Robert B. Waller, Jr.
A single rating could lead manufacturers to sacrifice in one area, such as compatibility with various vehicles, in favor of some other factor that weighs more in the rating, said Waller, of the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association.
That could result in angry consumers, frustrated that what they thought was the "best" seat won't fit in their car, he said.
Traffic accidents are the leading cause of death for children 14 and younger.
Properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in half, government officials say, but inspections indicate many parents do not know they are using the seats incorrectly.
Cischke said some of the more common mistakes were getting the wrong sized-seat for the child and moving an infant into a forward-facing seat too quickly.
financed periodic checkups at their dealerships with help from a private safety group, the National Safe Kids Campaign.
Under the program, more than 45,000 child seats have been inspected since 1996.
And starting this month, GM will have a minivan in each state that will be used to conduct car seat clinics at different sites.
DaimlerChrysler said parents who want an appointment for a checkup should call 1-877-FIT-4-A-KID or visit the Internet site www.fitforakid.org.
Safety experts recommend that small  infants ride in rear-facing child seats, but also strongly  recommend that rear-facing infant seats never be placed in front of  an air bag.
At least 15 infants have been killed this way by air bags since   1994, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.
Drivers would know the system was not working only because an   ``airbag off'' light would stay dark.
Mercedes-Benz said all known owners of BabySmart Infant and   Booster child seats were being notified, and special posters would  be hung in Mercedes-Benz dealerships.
Mercedes dealers will  exchange the seats for free.
The recall does not affect Toddler  seats.

"If the cooperation isn't there, we would have to regulate," Anderson warned.
They have since saved an estimated 100 lives in Canada.
In one case, a Canadian passenger was leaning over to adjust the radio when an airbag blasted him back into his seat and killed him, the paper said.
Previously, officers issued summonses only after stopping drivers for other reasons -- such as speeding -- and found them or their front-seat passengers without seat belts.
''We're taking a very big step in reducing the death and disability caused by motor-vehicle accidents in New Jersey,'' said Assemblyman Herb Conaway, D-Burlington, a sponsor of the measure Gov. Christie Whitman signed into law in January.
''By enforcing that requirement, we know the percentage of adults who wear seat belts will go up, but more importantly, the number of children will also go up,'' Conaway said.
The Seat Belt Safety Coalition of New Jersey has said the state's 62 percent compliance rate for seat belt use in the state falls below the national average of 68 percent.
The safety coalition predicts the greater enforcement will save up to 50 lives and prevent nearly 2,900 serious injuries per year.
The New Jersey chapter of the National Motorists Association opposed the change, arguing that it would be difficult to enforce and that the number of traffic deaths on New Jersey roads reached a 20-year low in 1999.
DaimlerChrysler AG is establishing a new service at about 20   percent of its dealerships to advise parents on how to install car  seats to protect children.
The company  will spend more than $10 million annually and the service will be  available at about 1,000 dealerships, company officials said today.
More than 80 percent of child seats are improperly installed in   autos.
``Parents need help to make sure their children are properly   secured in those seats,'' Robert Eaton, DaimlerChrysler  co-chairman, said at a news conference.
Next year, DaimlerChrysler will have the capacity to conduct   800,000 inspections annually to make sure children are buckled  properly and that child seats are properly installed in both new  and older DaimlerChrysler vehicles, the company officials said.
The company's move follows a recommendation by the National   Transportation Safety Board in January that a nationwide network of  ``fitting stations'' for child seats be established to prevent the  deaths of children in automobile accidents.
Each year, frustrated parents struggle to install about 70   models of child car seats in hundreds of types of cars with  different shapes of back seats, meaning there are ``potentially  100,000 different ways to confuse the average consumer,'' NTSB  Chairman Jim Hall says.
This decade, more than 60,000 children have died in traffic   crashes.
When Hall recommended the fitting stations, he envisioned them   across the United States at vehicle inspection sites, motor vehicle  administration offices, fire stations and automobile dealerships.
Hall had said the initiative should be financed out of government  transportation dollars, but he invited other groups and businesses  to get involved.
Since 1996, GM has worked with the National Safe Kids Campaign,   a nonprofit group that promotes child safety, to hold weekend or  daylong child-safety-seat checks at about 1,000 of the company's  dealerships.
Most auto manufacturers reacted coolly to the advisory from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, saying side air bags used in conjunction with age-appropriate restraints significantly enhance safety.
``We don't believe it's in the consumer's best interests,'' said Stuart Schorr, a Mercedes spokesman.
About 7,500 people in the United States each year die from side-impact crashes and a growing number of auto manufacturers are installing side air bags as standard or optional equipment to provide greater safety.
There have been no deaths or serious injuries attributed to side air bags.

DETROIT (AP) -- Mercedes-Benz has recalled 6,000 high-tech child   seats that automatically turn off passenger-side air bags when  installed, saying a flaw in the system might keep the air bags  turned on.
The system was designed to reduce the dangers of small children   in child seats near air bags.

Most auto manufacturers reacted coolly to the advisory from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, saying side air bags used in conjunction with age-appropriate restraints significantly enhance safety.
Although BMW already allows customers to tell dealers whether they want rear seat air bags activated, a Mercedes spokesman said the company has no plans to follow suit.
About 7,500 people in the United States each year die from side-impact crashes and a growing number of auto manufacturers are installing side air bags as standard or optional equipment to provide greater safety.
There have been no deaths or serious injuries attributed to side air bags.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- With federal regulators pondering whether they should start rating child safety seats, a major automaker began offering parents a free seat checkup service, regardless of what kind of car they have.

Studies show more than 80 percent of child seats are improperly installed.
Australia and Europe test safety seats and provide parents the results of those tests, while Japan is considering a rating system, noted Stephen R. Kratzke, NHTSA associate administrator for safety performance.
"A rating system that is simply a star system can hinder safety because parents stop asking questions," she said.
"Not all test data are of equal importance," she said, noting that measurements of head movement, chest acceleration and knee movement in a crash are among pieces of information collected.

A single rating could lead manufacturers to sacrifice in one area, such as compatibility with various vehicles, in favor of some other factor that weighs more in the rating, said Waller, of the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association.
He suggested improved instructions and warning labels for the seats, adding that some current mandatory labeling requires a 12th grade education to understand.
Traffic accidents are the leading cause of death for children 14 and younger.
Susan Cischke, DaimlerChrysler's vice president of regulatory affairs, said their research found that 96 percent of drivers with child seats believed the seats were installed properly -- even though less than 20 percent were.
Cischke said some of the more common mistakes were getting the wrong sized-seat for the child and moving an infant into a forward-facing seat too quickly.
Even before the NTSB recommendation, General Motors Corp.
financed periodic checkups at their dealerships with help from a private safety group, the National Safe Kids Campaign.
DaimlerChrysler said parents who want an appointment for a checkup should call 1-877-FIT-4-A-KID or visit the Internet site www.fitforakid.org.
The BabySmart seats send and receive signals from two antennas   in the seat cushion.
Drivers would know the system was not working only because an   ``airbag off'' light would stay dark.
Mercedes-Benz said all known owners of BabySmart Infant and   Booster child seats were being notified, and special posters would  be hung in Mercedes-Benz dealerships.
The recall does not affect Toddler  seats.
Auto airbags were introduced in the late 1980s to reduce accident injuries to drivers and passengers.
Now, airbags only meet specifications set by the United States, where they are tested on dummies that do not wear belts, because only 60 percent of Americans regularly wear seat belts.
In Canada, 92 percent drivers and passengers wear belts.
But the airbags are deployed with the same force as in the United States, which can kill or hurt people who are not sitting properly.
On Monday, police officers throughout New Jersey will have the authority to stop drivers who are not wearing seat belts.
''We're taking a very big step in reducing the death and disability caused by motor-vehicle accidents in New Jersey,'' said Assemblyman Herb Conaway, D-Burlington, a sponsor of the measure Gov. Christie Whitman signed into law in January.
Conaway, who is a doctor, said the change also will benefit children, who are the most vulnerable to injury in automobile accidents.
That figure rises to about 90 percent when adults wear their seat belts, Conaway said.
The AAA New Jersey Automobile Club reports that 60 percent of children killed in automobile accidents weren't wearing seat belts.
The safety coalition predicts the greater enforcement will save up to 50 lives and prevent nearly 2,900 serious injuries per year.
''It must be once a week that I have to tell a family member that someone died because they weren't wearing a seat belt,'' Dr. Jennifer Wailer, a trauma physician and chairwoman of the seat belt coalition, told The Press of Atlantic City in Sunday's editions.
''I can tell you it's very tiring, because this is preventable.
The New Jersey chapter of the National Motorists Association opposed the change, arguing that it would be difficult to enforce and that the number of traffic deaths on New Jersey roads reached a 20-year low in 1999.
More than 80 percent of child seats are improperly installed in   autos.
Also involved in the initiative, which will start in several   pilot cities this year and be fully in place next year, are  child-seat manufacturer Fisher-Price and the nonprofit National  Safety Council.
Next year, DaimlerChrysler will have the capacity to conduct   800,000 inspections annually to make sure children are buckled  properly and that child seats are properly installed in both new  and older DaimlerChrysler vehicles, the company officials said.
Over the next 16 months, DaimlerChrysler will be training 2,000   certified child-seat technicians in a 32-hour course -- doubling the  current number in the United States.
This decade, more than 60,000 children have died in traffic   crashes.
``I am  confident the other automobile manufacturers in our country will  step forward now with their own programs,'' he said.
also is considering some type of permanent   fitting stations in its dealerships, spokesman Greg Martin said.

Although BMW already allows customers to tell dealers whether they want rear seat air bags activated, a Mercedes spokesman said the company has no plans to follow suit.
``We don't believe it's in the consumer's best interests,'' said Stuart Schorr, a Mercedes spokesman.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched its look at ways to improve child seat safety, including a possible rating system, with a public hearing on Wednesday.

That could result in angry consumers, frustrated that what they thought was the "best" seat won't fit in their car, he said.
He suggested improved instructions and warning labels for the seats, adding that some current mandatory labeling requires a 12th grade education to understand.
NTSB Chairman Jim Hall urged automakers to also to offer checkups as a permanent feature in every dealership.
Traffic accidents are the leading cause of death for children 14 and younger.
Properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in half, government officials say, but inspections indicate many parents do not know they are using the seats incorrectly.
Even before the NTSB recommendation, General Motors Corp.
Under the program, more than 45,000 child seats have been inspected since 1996.
DaimlerChrysler said parents who want an appointment for a checkup should call 1-877-FIT-4-A-KID or visit the Internet site www.fitforakid.org.
The system was designed to reduce the dangers of small children   in child seats near air bags.
Safety experts recommend that small  infants ride in rear-facing child seats, but also strongly  recommend that rear-facing infant seats never be placed in front of  an air bag.
The BabySmart seats send and receive signals from two antennas   in the seat cushion.
Air bags in some Mercedes-Benz models are  supposed to recognize that a BabySmart seat has been installed and  turn off the passenger air bag.
