WASHINGTON (AP) -- With federal regulators pondering whether they should start rating child safety seats, a major automaker began offering parents a free seat checkup service, regardless of what kind of car they have.
DaimlerChrysler Corp.
began taking appointments Wednesday at 400 dealerships in 80 cities for child seat checkups.
Every year, parents struggle to install about 70 models of child car seats in hundreds of types of cars with different back seats.
Australia and Europe test safety seats and provide parents the results of those tests, while Japan is considering a rating system, noted Stephen R. Kratzke, NHTSA associate administrator for safety performance.
If a rating system is developed it needs to include real-world performance, not just crash-test results, Stephanie M. Tombrello of SafetyBeltSafe U.S.A. said.
"Not all test data are of equal importance," she said, noting that measurements of head movement, chest acceleration and knee movement in a crash are among pieces of information collected.
A single rating could lead manufacturers to sacrifice in one area, such as compatibility with various vehicles, in favor of some other factor that weighs more in the rating, said Waller, of the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association.
That could result in angry consumers, frustrated that what they thought was the "best" seat won't fit in their car, he said.
NTSB Chairman Jim Hall urged automakers to also to offer checkups as a permanent feature in every dealership.
Traffic accidents are the leading cause of death for children 14 and younger.
DaimlerChrysler said parents who want an appointment for a checkup should call 1-877-FIT-4-A-KID or visit the Internet site www.fitforakid.org.
The system was designed to reduce the dangers of small children   in child seats near air bags.
Safety experts recommend that small  infants ride in rear-facing child seats, but also strongly  recommend that rear-facing infant seats never be placed in front of  an air bag.
Air bags in some Mercedes-Benz models are  supposed to recognize that a BabySmart seat has been installed and  turn off the passenger air bag.
Mercedes-Benz said there have  been four reports that the indicator light was off, but no reports  of accidents or injuries.
The recall does not affect Toddler  seats.
OTTAWA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government has told automakers to improve airbag safety or face new regulations as early as the next fall.
"We must work together urgently to minimize the associated risks," Canadian Transport Minister David Anderson said in a letter to automakers.
They have since saved an estimated 100 lives in Canada.
However, airbags have also been implicated in the deaths of three Canadians, according to today's Financial Post newspaper.
In Canada, 92 percent drivers and passengers wear belts.
But the airbags are deployed with the same force as in the United States, which can kill or hurt people who are not sitting properly.
On Monday, police officers throughout New Jersey will have the authority to stop drivers who are not wearing seat belts.
Conaway, who is a doctor, said the change also will benefit children, who are the most vulnerable to injury in automobile accidents.
''By enforcing that requirement, we know the percentage of adults who wear seat belts will go up, but more importantly, the number of children will also go up,'' Conaway said.
The safety coalition predicts the greater enforcement will save up to 50 lives and prevent nearly 2,900 serious injuries per year.
''It must be once a week that I have to tell a family member that someone died because they weren't wearing a seat belt,'' Dr. Jennifer Wailer, a trauma physician and chairwoman of the seat belt coalition, told The Press of Atlantic City in Sunday's editions.
''I can tell you it's very tiring, because this is preventable.
The New Jersey chapter of the National Motorists Association opposed the change, arguing that it would be difficult to enforce and that the number of traffic deaths on New Jersey roads reached a 20-year low in 1999.
DaimlerChrysler is the first automaker to accept a federal   agency's challenge by creating a permanent free service using  trained personnel to help customers fit child seats.
Properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in  half, according to government statistics.
``Parents need help to make sure their children are properly   secured in those seats,'' Robert Eaton, DaimlerChrysler  co-chairman, said at a news conference.
Also involved in the initiative, which will start in several   pilot cities this year and be fully in place next year, are  child-seat manufacturer Fisher-Price and the nonprofit National  Safety Council.
Next year, DaimlerChrysler will have the capacity to conduct   800,000 inspections annually to make sure children are buckled  properly and that child seats are properly installed in both new  and older DaimlerChrysler vehicles, the company officials said.
Over the next 16 months, DaimlerChrysler will be training 2,000   certified child-seat technicians in a 32-hour course -- doubling the  current number in the United States.
There will be two per  participating dealership.
The company's move follows a recommendation by the National   Transportation Safety Board in January that a nationwide network of  ``fitting stations'' for child seats be established to prevent the  deaths of children in automobile accidents.
Each year, frustrated parents struggle to install about 70   models of child car seats in hundreds of types of cars with  different shapes of back seats, meaning there are ``potentially  100,000 different ways to confuse the average consumer,'' NTSB  Chairman Jim Hall says.
General Motors Corp.
also is considering some type of permanent   fitting stations in its dealerships, spokesman Greg Martin said.
Since 1996, GM has worked with the National Safe Kids Campaign,   a nonprofit group that promotes child safety, to hold weekend or  daylong child-safety-seat checks at about 1,000 of the company's  dealerships.

began taking appointments Wednesday at 400 dealerships in 80 cities for child seat checkups.
Under the program, which will grow to 1,000 dealerships by year's end, even adults driving a competitor's vehicle can ask DaimlerChrysler technicians if a child seat is properly installed and children are buckled in properly.
Every year, parents struggle to install about 70 models of child car seats in hundreds of types of cars with different back seats.
Studies show more than 80 percent of child seats are improperly installed.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched its look at ways to improve child seat safety, including a possible rating system, with a public hearing on Wednesday.
"A rating system that is simply a star system can hinder safety because parents stop asking questions," she said.
Parents need instructions in correct installation, Tombrello said.
"Not all test data are of equal importance," she said, noting that measurements of head movement, chest acceleration and knee movement in a crash are among pieces of information collected.
, who represents car seat manufacturers, said a single rating system could be misleading.
That could result in angry consumers, frustrated that what they thought was the "best" seat won't fit in their car, he said.
Another safety agency, the National Transportation Safety Board, called attention to the problem of wrongly installed seats, urging creation of a network of permanent "fitting stations" for child seats that the government, automakers and private safety agencies would operate jointly.
Properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in half, government officials say, but inspections indicate many parents do not know they are using the seats incorrectly.
Even before the NTSB recommendation, General Motors Corp.
financed periodic checkups at their dealerships with help from a private safety group, the National Safe Kids Campaign.
Under the program, more than 45,000 child seats have been inspected since 1996.
The system was designed to reduce the dangers of small children   in child seats near air bags.
Safety experts recommend that small  infants ride in rear-facing child seats, but also strongly  recommend that rear-facing infant seats never be placed in front of  an air bag.
The BabySmart seats send and receive signals from two antennas   in the seat cushion.
Air bags in some Mercedes-Benz models are  supposed to recognize that a BabySmart seat has been installed and  turn off the passenger air bag.
But Mercedes-Benz said Tuesday that if the child seat is pushed   forward when the seat back is leaning toward the dashboard, the  passenger airbag might not turn off as designed.
Mercedes-Benz said there have  been four reports that the indicator light was off, but no reports  of accidents or injuries.
Mercedes-Benz said all known owners of BabySmart Infant and   Booster child seats were being notified, and special posters would  be hung in Mercedes-Benz dealerships.
The recall does not affect Toddler  seats.
The government wants automakers to change airbag design voluntarily for 1998 models, make airbags to deploy with less force, and not to deploy at speeds as low as they do now.
However, airbags have also been implicated in the deaths of three Canadians, according to today's Financial Post newspaper.
Now, airbags only meet specifications set by the United States, where they are tested on dummies that do not wear belts, because only 60 percent of Americans regularly wear seat belts.
In Canada, 92 percent drivers and passengers wear belts.
In one case, a Canadian passenger was leaning over to adjust the radio when an airbag blasted him back into his seat and killed him, the paper said.
TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Drivers who have spent the last 15 years ignoring the state's seat belt law, listen up: The chance of getting hit with a $20 fine is growing.
On Monday, police officers throughout New Jersey will have the authority to stop drivers who are not wearing seat belts.
''We're taking a very big step in reducing the death and disability caused by motor-vehicle accidents in New Jersey,'' said Assemblyman Herb Conaway, D-Burlington, a sponsor of the measure Gov. Christie Whitman signed into law in January.
''By enforcing that requirement, we know the percentage of adults who wear seat belts will go up, but more importantly, the number of children will also go up,'' Conaway said.
The Seat Belt Safety Coalition of New Jersey has said the state's 62 percent compliance rate for seat belt use in the state falls below the national average of 68 percent.
Conaway said the council's statistics show children are belted in only 20 percent of the time when adults they ride with are not.
The safety coalition predicts the greater enforcement will save up to 50 lives and prevent nearly 2,900 serious injuries per year.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- When you get your car brakes checked or an oil   change at a DaimlerChrysler dealership next year, you also may be  able to get expert advice on whether a child seat is being used  correctly.
Properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in  half, according to government statistics.
By comparison, the National Safety Council estimates about   30,000 child seats a year are being inspected now at community  events.
Over the next 16 months, DaimlerChrysler will be training 2,000   certified child-seat technicians in a 32-hour course -- doubling the  current number in the United States.
The company's move follows a recommendation by the National   Transportation Safety Board in January that a nationwide network of  ``fitting stations'' for child seats be established to prevent the  deaths of children in automobile accidents.
Hall had said the initiative should be financed out of government  transportation dollars, but he invited other groups and businesses  to get involved.
``We don't believe it's in the consumer's best interests,'' said Stuart Schorr, a Mercedes spokesman.
About 7,500 people in the United States each year die from side-impact crashes and a growing number of auto manufacturers are installing side air bags as standard or optional equipment to provide greater safety.
What devices and procedures have been implemented to improve automobile safety?
Child safety seats prevent thousands of deaths and injuries annually, but federal officials and safety experts say a large share of those in use are not installed correctly, posing a possible hazard to children riding in them.

DETROIT (AP) -- Mercedes-Benz has recalled 6,000 high-tech child   seats that automatically turn off passenger-side air bags when  installed, saying a flaw in the system might keep the air bags  turned on.
The system was designed to reduce the dangers of small children   in child seats near air bags.
At least 15 infants have been killed this way by air bags since   1994, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.
The BabySmart seats send and receive signals from two antennas   in the seat cushion.

On Monday, police officers throughout New Jersey will have the authority to stop drivers who are not wearing seat belts.
Previously, officers issued summonses only after stopping drivers for other reasons -- such as speeding -- and found them or their front-seat passengers without seat belts.
''This isn't about punishment.
Conaway, who is a doctor, said the change also will benefit children, who are the most vulnerable to injury in automobile accidents.

That figure rises to about 90 percent when adults wear their seat belts, Conaway said.
The current fine of $20 will remain unchanged and offenders will not be subject to Division of Motor Vehicles points.
DaimlerChrysler AG is establishing a new service at about 20   percent of its dealerships to advise parents on how to install car  seats to protect children.
DaimlerChrysler is the first automaker to accept a federal   agency's challenge by creating a permanent free service using  trained personnel to help customers fit child seats.

Since 1996, GM has worked with the National Safe Kids Campaign,   a nonprofit group that promotes child safety, to hold weekend or  daylong child-safety-seat checks at about 1,000 of the company's  dealerships.
Federal regulators Thursday warned consumers that side air bags can kill or seriously injure children under 12 and urged manufacturers installing the devices in rear seats to let drivers decide if they want them activated.
Although BMW already allows customers to tell dealers whether they want rear seat air bags activated, a Mercedes spokesman said the company has no plans to follow suit.
