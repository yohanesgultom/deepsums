Child safety seats prevent thousands of deaths and injuries annually, but federal officials and safety experts say a large share of those in use are not installed correctly, posing a possible hazard to children riding in them.
began taking appointments Wednesday at 400 dealerships in 80 cities for child seat checkups.
Studies show more than 80 percent of child seats are improperly installed.
A single rating could lead manufacturers to sacrifice in one area, such as compatibility with various vehicles, in favor of some other factor that weighs more in the rating, said Waller, of the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association.
That could result in angry consumers, frustrated that what they thought was the "best" seat won't fit in their car, he said.
He suggested improved instructions and warning labels for the seats, adding that some current mandatory labeling requires a 12th grade education to understand.
Susan Cischke, DaimlerChrysler's vice president of regulatory affairs, said their research found that 96 percent of drivers with child seats believed the seats were installed properly -- even though less than 20 percent were.
Cischke said some of the more common mistakes were getting the wrong sized-seat for the child and moving an infant into a forward-facing seat too quickly.
DaimlerChrysler said parents who want an appointment for a checkup should call 1-877-FIT-4-A-KID or visit the Internet site www.fitforakid.org.
DETROIT (AP) -- Mercedes-Benz has recalled 6,000 high-tech child   seats that automatically turn off passenger-side air bags when  installed, saying a flaw in the system might keep the air bags  turned on.
Safety experts recommend that small  infants ride in rear-facing child seats, but also strongly  recommend that rear-facing infant seats never be placed in front of  an air bag.
The BabySmart seats send and receive signals from two antennas   in the seat cushion.
But Mercedes-Benz said Tuesday that if the child seat is pushed   forward when the seat back is leaning toward the dashboard, the  passenger airbag might not turn off as designed.
The recall does not affect Toddler  seats.
"We must work together urgently to minimize the associated risks," Canadian Transport Minister David Anderson said in a letter to automakers.
"If the cooperation isn't there, we would have to regulate," Anderson warned.
Auto airbags were introduced in the late 1980s to reduce accident injuries to drivers and passengers.
They have since saved an estimated 100 lives in Canada.
However, airbags have also been implicated in the deaths of three Canadians, according to today's Financial Post newspaper.
Now, airbags only meet specifications set by the United States, where they are tested on dummies that do not wear belts, because only 60 percent of Americans regularly wear seat belts.
In one case, a Canadian passenger was leaning over to adjust the radio when an airbag blasted him back into his seat and killed him, the paper said.
Previously, officers issued summonses only after stopping drivers for other reasons -- such as speeding -- and found them or their front-seat passengers without seat belts.
''We're taking a very big step in reducing the death and disability caused by motor-vehicle accidents in New Jersey,'' said Assemblyman Herb Conaway, D-Burlington, a sponsor of the measure Gov. Christie Whitman signed into law in January.
''By enforcing that requirement, we know the percentage of adults who wear seat belts will go up, but more importantly, the number of children will also go up,'' Conaway said.
Conaway said the council's statistics show children are belted in only 20 percent of the time when adults they ride with are not.
That figure rises to about 90 percent when adults wear their seat belts, Conaway said.
''It must be once a week that I have to tell a family member that someone died because they weren't wearing a seat belt,'' Dr. Jennifer Wailer, a trauma physician and chairwoman of the seat belt coalition, told The Press of Atlantic City in Sunday's editions.
The New Jersey chapter of the National Motorists Association opposed the change, arguing that it would be difficult to enforce and that the number of traffic deaths on New Jersey roads reached a 20-year low in 1999.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- When you get your car brakes checked or an oil   change at a DaimlerChrysler dealership next year, you also may be  able to get expert advice on whether a child seat is being used  correctly.
The company  will spend more than $10 million annually and the service will be  available at about 1,000 dealerships, company officials said today.
When Hall recommended the fitting stations, he envisioned them   across the United States at vehicle inspection sites, motor vehicle  administration offices, fire stations and automobile dealerships.
also is considering some type of permanent   fitting stations in its dealerships, spokesman Greg Martin said.
Although BMW already allows customers to tell dealers whether they want rear seat air bags activated, a Mercedes spokesman said the company has no plans to follow suit.
``We don't believe it's in the consumer's best interests,'' said Stuart Schorr, a Mercedes spokesman.

The BabySmart seats send and receive signals from two antennas   in the seat cushion.
Air bags in some Mercedes-Benz models are  supposed to recognize that a BabySmart seat has been installed and  turn off the passenger air bag.
The company recommended the seats not be used and that children   sit in the back seat until the problem is fixed.
Mercedes dealers will  exchange the seats for free.
They have since saved an estimated 100 lives in Canada.
However, airbags have also been implicated in the deaths of three Canadians, according to today's Financial Post newspaper.
Now, airbags only meet specifications set by the United States, where they are tested on dummies that do not wear belts, because only 60 percent of Americans regularly wear seat belts.
But the airbags are deployed with the same force as in the United States, which can kill or hurt people who are not sitting properly.

More than 80 percent of child seats are improperly installed in   autos.
By comparison, the National Safety Council estimates about   30,000 child seats a year are being inspected now at community  events.
The company's move follows a recommendation by the National   Transportation Safety Board in January that a nationwide network of  ``fitting stations'' for child seats be established to prevent the  deaths of children in automobile accidents.
Each year, frustrated parents struggle to install about 70   models of child car seats in hundreds of types of cars with  different shapes of back seats, meaning there are ``potentially  100,000 different ways to confuse the average consumer,'' NTSB  Chairman Jim Hall says.
When Hall recommended the fitting stations, he envisioned them   across the United States at vehicle inspection sites, motor vehicle  administration offices, fire stations and automobile dealerships.
Hall said at the press conference that DaimlerChrysler's effort   went beyond what he suggested for the fitting stations.

Since 1996, GM has worked with the National Safe Kids Campaign,   a nonprofit group that promotes child safety, to hold weekend or  daylong child-safety-seat checks at about 1,000 of the company's  dealerships.
Federal regulators Thursday warned consumers that side air bags can kill or seriously injure children under 12 and urged manufacturers installing the devices in rear seats to let drivers decide if they want them activated.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched its look at ways to improve child seat safety, including a possible rating system, with a public hearing on Wednesday.
If a rating system is developed it needs to include real-world performance, not just crash-test results, Stephanie M. Tombrello of SafetyBeltSafe U.S.A. said.
"A rating system that is simply a star system can hinder safety because parents stop asking questions," she said.
Kathleen Weber of the University of Michigan Medical School suggested the possibility of a weighted rating system that included explanations of tradeoffs.

OTTAWA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government has told automakers to improve airbag safety or face new regulations as early as the next fall.
The government wants automakers to change airbag design voluntarily for 1998 models, make airbags to deploy with less force, and not to deploy at speeds as low as they do now.
"We must work together urgently to minimize the associated risks," Canadian Transport Minister David Anderson said in a letter to automakers.

The safety coalition predicts the greater enforcement will save up to 50 lives and prevent nearly 2,900 serious injuries per year.
The current fine of $20 will remain unchanged and offenders will not be subject to Division of Motor Vehicles points.
Properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in  half, according to government statistics.
Next year, DaimlerChrysler will have the capacity to conduct   800,000 inspections annually to make sure children are buckled  properly and that child seats are properly installed in both new  and older DaimlerChrysler vehicles, the company officials said.
There will be two per  participating dealership.
